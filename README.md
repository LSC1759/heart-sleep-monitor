# Watches thou heart
## info:
## heart going insane during sleep so i cured it (im gonna die)


---Lazy to do list---

* Use eufy api to maybe utilize room lights for warning

* Add ESP button to remotely stop the code (to prevent earrape)
  
* ESP leds for indication? why not haha

* Flatline and disconnect detection? (what if it doesnt change value for 5 seconds, consider it disconnected? flatline depends on what watch will do when it doesnt detect beating heart)
